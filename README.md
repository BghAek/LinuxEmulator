Hello everyone , 
before downloading this code you need to setup the right envirement for it to work in your local PC, 
follow the steps : 
- first of all you need to download .NET 6 ( because we usend ASP.net 6 to develop this app) .
- Make sure you have a server you can use Virtual box and install headless UBUNTU server on a virtual machine .
- after that you need to modify the code by changing the ip adress to your server ip@ and the username and the password of you server all in /Controllers/HomeController.cs .
